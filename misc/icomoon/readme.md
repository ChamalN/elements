Go to the IcoMoon app (https://icomoon.io/app).

You can import *selection.json* back to the IcoMoon app using the *Import Icons* input (or via Main Menu â†’ Manage Projects) to retrieve your icon selection. It'll be called "icomoon" even though we're using Font-Awesome. If only IcoMoon icons are shown on the page, scroll down to the link "Add Icons from Library" and choose Font-Awesome ("Add" button).

To select from Font-Awesome, make sure the "select" button at the top of the page is selected (it looks like a mouse arrow in a box, has an invisible name of "select") and click on icons you'd like to add. Selected icons get an orange border and white background. Then go back to your "icomoon" group and click the stripey bar (button with the invisible name of "Menu") to show a submenu. With only your new icons selected, choose "Copy selection to set", then make sure all the icons in your "icomoon" group are selected. The sticky menu at the bottom of the screen has a link "Generate Font" which will give you both new font files and a new selection.json.
